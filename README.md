# Predicting_Credit_Risk
will be building a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan will be approved or not

Prediction
Pre-emptively, I believe that the Random Forest model will perform better just by looking at what is in the data and will be building our predictions off of. Since the Random Forest Model will test and weight different decision trees to find what the best model output, fill that all-in-all it would have a a better prediction accuracy.

Final Analysis
While the Training scores held true to my predicitions, I found it interesting that the testing score for the Logistic Refression was actually higher. The scores for both really close only have a .006 difference in the training model and the testing models only having a difference of .0006 .  Under these findings, my assumption is that the Random Forest model might have over fitted its model which led to it being slightly lower. It was an eyeopener on how overfitting or underfitting can definitely affect your prediction scores.
